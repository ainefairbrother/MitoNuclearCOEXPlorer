# Mito-nuclear Brain Browser

Welcome to the mito-nuclear brain browser. This tool allows exploration of relationships between target gene(s) of nuclear origin and the mitochondrial genome
Levaraging transcriptomic data from the GTEx project, nuclear-mitochondrial co-ordination was quantified by correlating expression levels of nDNA- and mtDNA-encoded genes. The rationale here being that co-expressed genes may be directly regulating each other, controlled by the same regulatory regime, functionally related, members of the same pathway or part of the same protein complex, and as such, the correlation of their expression is meaningful.
